# Create a database for the project management system

The document titled "project.pdf" provides an overview of a database project. It starts with an introduction to databases and mentions that it is the final project for a course called CCCS 215. The project involves creating a database for a project management system.

The document includes information about the students involved in the project, their names, IDs, and email addresses. It then proceeds to describe the different phases of the project. In Phase 1, the systems analysis and entity-relationship (E-R) model are completed. The document includes tables representing entities and their attributes. It also explains the relationships between different entities, such as "Project and Client" and "Employee and Department."

In Phase 2, the document discusses logical modeling and normalization. It mentions the normalization levels (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) and states that the final result schema consists of six relations, including PROJECT, ORDER, CLIENT, EMPLOYEE, EMPLOYEE_SKILL, and DEPARTMENT. It provides the primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) for each relation.

Phase 3 focuses on the physical implementation of the database. It includes SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) statements for table creation and specifications for each table. The document also mentions SQL statements for inserting data into the tables. It further discusses the design and implementation of queries using SQL, including the use of WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, SUM), and different types of joins (INNER JOIN, EQUI JOIN, OUTER JOIN). Additionally, it suggests the design of two stored procedures, an update procedure, and a select procedure.

The document concludes by mentioning the distribution of tasks among the project members for each phase, including the design, implementation, and file format.
